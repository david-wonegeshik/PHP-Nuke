PHP-Nuke: Advanced Content Management System
============================================

February 2002: Version 5.5
==========================
- Added a very cool function to check if a module is activated. Call it: is_active("Module_Name");
  Returns 1 if active or 0 if not. Use the module "title" in the database to make the check
  This will help in the future to really integrate all modules with the core system and to establish
  some dependencies between parts of the site.
- Added Send Private Message to any user from Your Account page, also check if user exists
- Removed some unused variables in user's system when edit home and theme
- Fixed morelink structure
- Fixed comments inclusion and comments bar show in article's page
- Fixed the Random Headlines block to correctly select the topic
- Fixed quotes bugs in Search module, Downloads search and Web Links search
- Administration online manual has been removed because it became too obsolet (PDF detailed manuals in
  the future)
- Removed the check for "(" and ")" from mainfile.php because problems with some modules
- Fixed slashes bug in Search module
- Fixed Surveys votes results in article's attached poll
- Fixed to solve bad url entries in user's page
- Fixed bad variable name that prevents to view comments according with your cookie options
- Added voteinclude.php file in Downloads module
- Modularized all translations. The new schema: Administration texts are in /admin/language/, Core system texts
  including all blocks' texts are in the usual directory /language/ and each module has its own language directory.
  This is more annoying to translate but the performance gain is great. There is anew function to call translations
  from a module, you can use the following syntax:
  require_once("mainfile.php");
  $module_name = basename(dirname(__FILE__));
  get_lang($module_name);  
- Added TRANSLATION text file with translations credits (Reason: too complicated to strip the credits from each
  translation with the script that modularized them, anyway is much more organized on this way and we can save
  previous translations credits in a more easy way)
- Private Messages has been converted into a module
- Changed Printer Friendly Page and Send to a Friend icons and added icons to options blocks
- Fixed query limit bug in Stories Archive module
- Fixed Content block link to open specific page and not the index
- Removed default administrator. The system will create one with your info on the very first run or admin.php
  (and since this can be security issue, the best is to do this as the first step on your fresh installation,
  this warning has been added on INSTALL file and in the default system message in bold fonts.)
- Topics module now opens a new index instead of search page (search option enabled at the top of the page)
- Fixed a typo in the downloads module and in the Top's page (downloads stats)
- Added article's rating system
- Added most voted and best rated stories in Top's module
- Added Score information in $morelink
- Added Score information in Stories Archive
- Fixed some english translation typos in Web Links module
- Fixed links and downloads categories parentid fields type, changed from tinyint() to int()
- Added GZ compression to increase the load speed (This function requires at least PHP 4.0.4 compiled with zlib,
  so if you want to remove it, just delete the first code line in mainfile.php where you read: ob_start("ob_gzhandler");
  Thanks for this suggestion goes to Andrej Lesjak from http://www.poljub.com)
