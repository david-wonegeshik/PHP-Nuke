PHP-Nuke: Web Portal System
===========================

- How to support PHP-Nuke project?

    I made this software free, and released it under GPL, so this software
costs you exactly "nothing". All that I ask you is, if you use it "please"
leave a link from your pages to http://phpnuke.org saying at least "Powered by
PHP-Nuke so others can know that you're using PHP-Nuke. That's all I ask.

    If you want to make me a donation, please contact me by email at
fbc@mandrakesoft.com I'll appreciate any money, books or new/used hardware
you want to donate me. I promise to improve this software and make more
for web production.

    If you want to donate something without mail me, just send your donation to:
    
	Francisco Burzi C.
	Av. Principal Pueblo Nuevo
	Via Poligono de Tiro
	Casa # Z-1315
	San Cristobal, 5001
	Estado Tachira
	VENEZUELA

    If you send me any Windows related stuff you will be burn in hell, for sure! 
    Send all you want for Linux, or anything that works on Linux.

    If you really want to be nice with me and give me something cool, please visit
my Wish List at Amazon and buy me whatever you want from my list. You can view it at:

    Finally, if you use PHP-Nuke in your site, please let me know and I'll put
a link back to your site from mine in the PHP-Nuke page. For this please use the
"Submit News" link on the main page. Ok?

    Enjoy this software!
