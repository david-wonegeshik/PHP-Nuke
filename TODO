PHP-NUKE: Web Portal System
===========================

For the Next Version you can expect:

- Online E-Books generator (open participation capability)
- Atomic Journal
- Open Directory backend
- Manuals! Administrators, Users and Developers
- Splatt Forum Integration (to replace the actual forums)

For the future versions I'll add some cool features, basicaly:

- Users Groups
- Freshmeat reverse engineer module
- File Sharing module
- Gnutella frontend module
- Glossary
- Themes Builder
- Quotes system
- Walk in the code to add/remove shit when needed
- Better and 100% "working" moderation system
- Some other cool features. Do you have any ideas on how to improve PHP-Nuke?

In the long-long future I'd like to add:

- Virtual Store (e-Shopping)
- Some others crazy stuff ;)

If you have any ideas, modification, suggestion, etc, please email
