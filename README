PHP-Nuke: Web Portal System
===========================


Welcome to PHP-Nuke!

First of all, thanks a lot to download this software, I hope that you
can enjoy it.

PHP-Nuke is free software, released under GNU GPL Licence version 2.0
(see COPYING file for details)

PHP-Nuke is the result of many years administrating a news site called
Linux Preview (http://linuxpreview.org). First, around August 1998, I
wrote my own code in Perl called NUKE and used it for about 1 year,
then my site goes big, so I needed a more powerfull system and decided
to use Slash, the same used in Slashdot site. It's good but you realy
need to know Perl to modify it, need too many modules, need to load
a damn daemon that sucks all your CPU power. My Pentium III just appears
to be a 386 each minute the daemon make its work. Well, then I discovered
Thatware, a good project to have a news site under PHP. I learned PHP
in less than a week and initiate to modify it. There are too many mods
to mention, it was practicaly a rewrite. I added some cool stuff, deleted
some others and after more than 380 hours of hard work in 3 weeks! PHP-Nuke
was born.

On August 17, 2000 I sold LinuxPreview.org to LinuxAlianza.com and now
I have all the time to dedicate to the development of PHP-Nuke.

For installation instructions, go and read INSTALL file, also remember
to read CREDITS file to know from where comes the things. The TODO file
is the list of features that I'll add in future versions, read it also.

Please, enjoy PHP-Nuke and remember that this is free GPL software and
comes without any warranty and without technical support, so please don't
email me asking how to make this or that, I'll ignore that type of emails.

PHP-Nuke isn't perfect, but your suggestions and feedback can help all
us to have a very well done portal system!

PS: Sorry for my English, I'm not english spoken guy. Also, remember I receive
too many Emails, so I can't answer to all you, but for sure I'll read all
Emails I receive.
